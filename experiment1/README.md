Experiment 1
---

In experiment 1, I will simulate match up between random "teams". Each team will have a value, determining how good a team is. A team with a higher value will always defeat a team with a lower value. I will attempt to find as many good teams as possible through a limited number of matchups and tallying the number of victories per team.
